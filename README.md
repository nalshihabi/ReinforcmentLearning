# Simple Reinforcment Learning Implementations
Implementations of popular reinfocment learning algorithms integrated with OpenAI Gym. Meant to be easy to understand.

## Prerequisites
```
gym==0.12.1
tensorflow==1.13.1
numpy==1.16.2
scipy==1.2.1
```

## Getting Started
To get started first clone the repo localy. Currently the only algorithm implemented is A2C, to run A2C move to the ReinforcmentLearning\vanillaPolicyGradient folder in terminal and start it by running:

```
python main.py
```
The agent should begin to train automatically and a non training agent will render the game with an up to date network. 

## Configurations
Flags are not yet implemented, to change the enironment or number of parallel agents simply change the corresponding variables in the main.py file.
